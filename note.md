In Clerk authentication, the functions
useAuth(), auth(), and currentUser() are commonly
used to handle user authentication and retrieve information about the currently logged-in user. Here's an explanation of each function:

# useAuth(): This function is a hook provided by Clerk that allows you to access the authentication-related functionality within your application. By calling useAuth(), you can access the authentication state and user information, such as the current user's ID, email, and other details. This hook typically returns an object with properties and methods related to authentication.

Example usage:

import { useAuth } from '@clerk/clerk-react';

function MyComponent() {
const { user } = useAuth();

// Access user information
console.log(user.id);
console.log(user.email);

// ... rest of the component
}

# auth(): This function is provided by Clerk and offers a set of methods for authentication-related operations, such as signing in, signing out, and other authentication flows. With auth(), you can perform actions like creating a new user account, logging in, resetting passwords, and more.

Example usage:
import { auth } from '@clerk/clerk-react';

// Sign in example
async function signIn(email, password) {
try {
await auth.signIn(email, password);
console.log('Sign in successful!');
} catch (error) {
console.error('Sign in failed:', error);
}
}

# currentUser(): This function is also provided by Clerk and returns the current user object. The currentUser() function allows you to access information about the currently logged-in user, such as their email, ID, and any custom data associated with their account.

Example usage:

import { currentUser } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node';

const user = currentUser();

console.log(user.id);
console.log(user.email);
